another piece of clothing with oakland's name on it did not need to exist.

ૡૡૡ

when i was a youngster the punk kids had homemade non-patches on their jackets. DRI. Suicidal Tendencies.

they were scary-cool and i was just a mortal. a lot of the clothes i make are based on how i saw them. tiny idols.

47 safety pins later, a tiny tribute.
